A production function is a mathematical representation of real production/output. A ==two-period production function== is defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
&y_1=A_1f(k_1, n_1) \\
&y_2=A_2f(k_2, n_2) \\
\end{align}
$$
	Where $y_t$ is the output, $A_t=1$ is total factor productivity (efficiency), $k_t$ is the input of capital, and $n_t$ is the input of labor at time $t$.

> **Example**: A coffee shop on the corner uses both coffee machines *(capital)* and workers *(labor)* to create, via some production function $f(k, n)$, coffee for its patrons.
