There are two types of macroeconomic investment (the change in quantity of capital from one period to the next):
$$
\begin{alignat}{}
{inv}_1=k_2-k_1 \\
{inv}^{gross}={inv}+{\delta k_1} = k_2 - (1-\delta)k_1
\end{alignat}
$$
	Where (between period 1 and 2) $inv_1$ is the net investment (does not include **economic depreciation**), while ${inv}^{gross}$ is the gross investment and $0 \leq \delta \leq 1$ is the constant rate of depreciation ($\delta^{US} = .08$ since ==roughly 8%== of the nation's stock depreciates every year).

There is a very slight qualitative difference between net and gross investment, since $\delta$ is constant over time and is outside of the firm's control. However, this difference matters in a quantitative sense, where gross investment is favored.

In terms of net investment, the depreciated value $\delta k_1$ is added because we are trying to find out the total investment for the period.

>Example: A firm has $k_1$ capital goods in the beginning of period 1. It buys $x$ capital goods over period 1, ending the period with $k_2=x+(1-\delta)k_1$ capital goods. The gross investment is ${inv}^{gross} = x$.
