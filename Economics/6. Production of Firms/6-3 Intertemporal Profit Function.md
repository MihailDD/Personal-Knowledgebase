Using the [[6-1 The Production Function|production function]], we define the intertemporal (lifetime) profit function of a small firm as:
$$
\underbrace{\textstyle P_1A_1f(k_1,n_1)}_{\mathclap{\text{Period 1 Revenue}}} - 
\underbrace{\textstyle P_1(k_2-k_1) -P_1w_1n_1}_{\mathclap{\text{Period 1 Total Costs}}} + \underbrace{\textstyle \frac{P_2A_2f(k_2,n_2)}{1+i}}_{\mathclap{\text{Period 2 Revenue}}} -
\underbrace{\textstyle \frac{P_1(k_3-k_2)}{1+i} -\frac{P_2w_2n_2}{1+i}}_{\mathclap{\text{Period 2 Total Costs}}}=0
$$
	Where $P_t$ is the price of final goods, $w_t$ is the real market wage, and $k_t$ is the firm's accumulated capital at period $t$, whereas $i$ is the nominal interest between period $t-1$ and $t$. By default $A_1=A_2=1$.

**Model Assumptions**
	1. The profit function is written in nominal terms. To write in real terms, replace $i$ with $r$ (the real interest rate).
	2. There is no distinction between the price of output goods and capital goods, both of which share the final price $P_t$ for period $t$ for simplification. A more elaborate representation would include the price of capital goods as $P_t^k$ in both total cost portions of the equation.
	3. The constant $k_1=c$ is predetermined, since it is outside of our analysis.
	4. The constant $k_3=0$ by default, since the framework ends after period 2.
