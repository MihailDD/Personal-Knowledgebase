The canonical [[6-1 The Production Function|production functional form]] for aggregate GDP is the [[6-8 Cobb-Douglas Production|Cobb-Douglas production function]]:
$$
f(K_t,X_tN_t) = Y_t = K_t^\alpha(X_tN_t)^{1-\alpha}
$$
	Where $X$ is the labor-augmenting technology, $K$ is capital stock, $N$ is labor, $\alpha \in (0,1)$ measures the importance of $K$ in the production of GDP, while at time $t$, $Y_t$ is the GDP, and $XN$ is effective labor. For developed economies, $\alpha = \frac{1}{3}$.

Using $X_t^{\alpha-1} = A_t$, we can rewrite the Cobb-Douglas as:
$$Y_t = A_tK_t^\alpha N_t^{1-\alpha}$$
