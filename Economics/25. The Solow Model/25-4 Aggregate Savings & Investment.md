The Solow Model is based on a closed-economy structure, meaning that net exports are excluded from the GDP equation. Also, government spending is not crucial for the Solow framework, leaving us with:$$
Y_t=C_t+I_t
$$...and since $S_t = Y_t - C_t$ from the basic consumption-savings framework:
$$
S_t=I_t
$$
	This implies that economy-wide savings are the source of funding for economy-wide investment.

In addition to this, $s \in (0,1)$ denotes the savings rate as a fraction of GDP:
$$
S_t=s \cdot Y_t
$$
Swapping with [[6-5 Net & Gross Investment|investment]], this leaves us with:
$$
\begin{alignat}{0}
I_t=s \cdot Y_t
\\\text{or}\\
K_{t+1}-(1-\delta)K_t=s \cdot Y_t
\end{alignat}
$$
However, since the Solow model cannot take near-infinite levels of GDP (or quantities of consumption, savings or investment), the framework must be **normalized**/**de-trended**.
