Exogenous (out-of-model) growth refers to growth which happens out of a model and is imposed into said model. Two main sources of growth in an economy are the ==population growth rate== (${gr_N}$) and ==total factor productivity growth rate== ($gr_X$), denoted as:
$$
gr_N = \frac{N_{t+1}}{N_{t}} - 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ gr_X = \frac{X_{t+1}}{X_{t}} - 1
$$
	Where in period $t$ , $N_t$ is the aggregate employment (in units of workers or hours) and $X_t$ is total factor productivity, or the *Solow residual*. Both rates are nearly constant for every time period, hence why there are no time subscripts. Note that $gr_N^{US} = 0.013$.
