>[!note] Equation of Motion for Capital
>Capital accumulation is the process of acquiring capital over time, defined as 
>$$K_{t+1}=K_t(1-\delta)+I_t$$
>where $K_t$ and $I_t$ are capital and investment respectively at period $t$, while $\delta$ is the depreciation rate.
# Intuition
Capital usually has a time-to-build associated with it. We need time to purchase large machinery, or to build new factories. Therefore, **investment from one period usually carries onto the next as capital.** Conversely, investment is largely dependent on the [[2.1 User Cost & Steady-State Capital|user cost]] and the ***expected*** marginal product of capital $K_{t+1}$. This is because for firms to invest in capital, they need an incentive in the form of profits, only possible when $MP_K \geq r + \delta$.
