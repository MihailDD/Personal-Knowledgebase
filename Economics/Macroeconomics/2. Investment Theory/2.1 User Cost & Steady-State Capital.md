>[!note] User Cost of Capital
>The user cost of capital is the cost of holding capital over saving, denoted as
>$$MP_K = \delta + r$$
>where $MP_K$ is the marginal cost of capital, $\delta$ is the depreciation rate, and $r$ is the real interest rate (opportunity cost) foregone by not saving.
# Proof & Intuition
Suppose the price of capital is $1. When a firm earns one more unit of profit, it has two options:
1. **Invest it by buying capital**. In this way, in the next period the firm gains a marginal return on this unit of capital, and can sell the depreciated capital for a monetary gain of $MP_K+1-\delta$.
2. **Save it to earn interest.** If the firm decides to NOT buy capital, but to earn interest on the money instead, in the next period the firm simply has the original unit of profit *plus* interest on it, in this case $1+r$.
The above equations have to be equally profitable to the firm in equilibrium. Therefore,
$$MP_K+1-\delta=1+r$$
Or more simply,
$$MP_K=r+\delta$$
This means that capital **is in equilibrium** only when the above equation holds. To gain further understanding, we can plot the variables on the following graph:
```tikz
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$K$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$MP_K$};
    \draw[-] (0, 4) arc (180:270:3.5) node[right]{$MP_K$};
    \draw[dashed] (4,1.3) -- (0,1.3) node[left]{$r+\delta$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.25,1.3) -- (1.25,0) node[below]{$K^*$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
- If $K < K^*$, then $MP_K > r + \delta$ and so the firm needs to buy more capital. 
- Conversely, if $K > K^*$, then $MP_K < r+\delta$, so the firm needs to increase their savings.

Only when $K=K^*$ is capital in steady-state equilibrium.
# Example
>[!example] Cobb-Douglas Production
>The Cobb-Douglas Production Function $Y=K^\frac{1}{3}L^\frac{2}{3}$ can be neatly combined with the user cost of capital. Let's take the marginal product of capital for the given function, equating
>$$MP_K=\frac{1}{3}K^{-\frac{2}{3}}L^\frac{2}{3}.$$
>Solving for $K*$,
>$$K*=(3MP_K)^{-\frac{3}{2}}L$$
>Plugging in $r+\delta$,
>$$K*=[3(r+\delta)]^{-\frac{3}{2}}L.$$
>Note that the more labor is in production, the higher the product. This is because $MP_K$ increases with labor.
