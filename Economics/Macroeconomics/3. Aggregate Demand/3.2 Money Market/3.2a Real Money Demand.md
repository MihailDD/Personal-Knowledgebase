>[!note] Demand for Real Money Balances
>The demand for real money balances (purchasing power) can be defined as
>$$\left(\frac{M}{P}\right)^d=L(Y^+, MT^-, r^-)$$
>where $M$ is the nominal monetary supply, $P$ is the price level, $Y$ is income/output, $MT$ is the availability of "money technologies" (how easy it is to access monetary holdings through technologies such as ATMs), and $r$ is the interest rate.
# Intuition
By focusing on real money balances ($\frac{M}{P}$), we are isolating people's desire to hold cash when controlling for the price of goods ($P$). The three key factors affecting the demand for real money balances are:
1. Income ($Y$): The richer people are, the more money they will hold. Buying more goods means engaging in more transactions, and therefore needing more cash availability.
2. Interest Rate ($r$): Keeping money in your wallet means that you give up the interest that you could earn holding your money in an interest-bearing account. **Essentially interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding cash.**
3. Technologies related to money demand ($MT$): Since accessing your money from an ATM is so easy nowadays, it is much harder to keep the real money demand high. We can plot the real money demand against the interest rate:

\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$\frac{M}{P}$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$L(Y, MT, r)$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
Note that a change in income $Y$ or "money technologies" ($MT$) will shift the curve.
