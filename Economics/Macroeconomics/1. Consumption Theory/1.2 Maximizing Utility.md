# Intuition
To gain more insight into the idea behind the tangency condition, let's suppose we give our agent one additional unit of income. Then, our agent has 2 choices:

1. Consume the additional income today (in period 1).
2. Save it and consume in tomorrow (in period 2), after earning interest on it.

Option 1 simply raises our agent's [[1.1 The Utility Function|total utility]] by $MU(c_1)$. Since our agent gains interest on their savings, and (most probably) values the future less relative to today, option 2 increases their total utility by $\beta (1+r)MU(c_2)$.

So why should the two sides equate? Well, consider a scenario where $$MU(c_1) > \beta(1+r)MU(c_2).$$This means that the agent gets more marginal utility from spending in period 1 than from saving for period 2. However, this also means that the **agent is not maximizing their utility**, since they could be getting more utility from spending more in period 1! Therefore, since we already made the assumption that the agent is a utility maximizer, we have to ensure that the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$ are such that $MU(c_1) = \beta(1+r)MU(c_2)$, and so the agent from the scenario has to spend more and save less.
