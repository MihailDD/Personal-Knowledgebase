# Intuition
Essentially, the budget constraint says that consumption cannot exceed income over the two periods. However, let's try to derive the constraint on our own.

1. For period 1, income can be utilized in two ways: spending and saving. Therefore, $$y_1=c_1+s_1.$$
2. For period 2, the agent receives their income plus (or minus) their interest-adjusted savings (or debt). Therefore, $$y_2+(1+r)s_1=c_2.$$
Rearranging the second equation as $s_1=\frac{c_2}{1+r}+\frac{y_2}{1+r}$ and replacing $s_1$ in the first equation leads to our desired budget constraint.
