>[!note] Utility Function
>The two-period utility function of a rational agent with incomes $y_1$, $y_2$ and consumption $c_1$ and $c_2$ can be written as
>$$U(c_1, c_2)=u(c_1)+\beta u(c_2)$$
>where $\beta$ is the discount factor, measuring the degree to which the agent prefers present consumption over future consumption (e.g. when $\beta = 1$ the agent's utility has equal weight over both periods).
>Some assumptions can be made about the agent's utility function:
>1. The agent is allowed to save or borrow in P1 at an interest rate $r$.
>2. The agent cannot have any remaining debt at the end of P2.
>4. The agent has diminishing marginal utility.
