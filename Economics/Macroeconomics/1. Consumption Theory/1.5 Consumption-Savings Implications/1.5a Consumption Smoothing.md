>[!note] Consumption Smoothing
>Consumption smoothing is the ability to keep consumption stable over a period of time despite a fluctuating income by accordingly adjusting spending and saving. 
>
>This includes saving during periods of high income and withdrawing/borrowing during periods of low income to ensure a consistent standard of living

>[!example] Two-Agent Economy
>Suppose agent A has an endowment pattern $(y_1^A, y_2^A)=(1, 0)$ and agent B has an endowment pattern $(y_1^B, y_2^B)=(0, 1)$. Both of them have an identical utility function. Their consumption-savings functions can be derived as:
>$$c_1^A=\frac{1}{2}$$
>$$c_1^B=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{1+r}$$
>Solving for the interest rate, we are in a closed economy with no government or investment so $Y=C$, or $Ny_1^A+Ny_1^B=Nc_1^A+Nc_1^B$. Plugging in our values,
>$$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{1+r}.$$
>Therefore,
>$$c_1^A = c_1^B = \frac{1}{2}.$$
