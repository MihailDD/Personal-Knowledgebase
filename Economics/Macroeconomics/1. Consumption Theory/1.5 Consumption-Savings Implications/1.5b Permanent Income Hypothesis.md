>[!note] Permanent Income
>The permanent income hypothesis, coined by Milton Friedman, states that an agent bases off their consumption off of their long-term average (permanent) income rather than their current (cyclical) income. Mathematically,

# Intuition
So why does the equation above hold? Consider the component $\frac{1}{T}\sum^{T}_{i}y_i^c$. Since it's the average of the cyclical components of an agent's income, it "averages out" to $\approx 0$, because positive and negative cyclical changes of an agent's income are random and unsystematic, therefore canceling most each other out over a long time, leaving us with a very small remainder. Therefore, PIH holds by $c_1 = y_p$.
