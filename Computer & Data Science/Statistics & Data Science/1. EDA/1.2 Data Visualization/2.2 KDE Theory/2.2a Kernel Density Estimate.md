>[!note] KDE Formula
>A kernel density estimate is a smooth, continuous function that approximates the underlying probability distribution of a dataset. Mathematically,
>$$f_a(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}K_\alpha(x, x_i),$$
>where $K_\alpha(x, x_i)$ is the kernel centered at observation $x_i$, $x$ represents a vector of all values in the dataset (or on the number line), and $\alpha$ is the bandwidth/smoothing parameter. Note that we divide the sum by $\frac{1}{n}$ to normalize the area under the curve.

# Examples
>[!example] Gaussian Kernel
> The Gaussian kernel can be expressed as
> $$K_\alpha(x, x_i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \alpha^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-x_i)^2}{2\alpha^2}},$$
> where the bandwidth $\alpha$ acts as a standard deviation and $x_i$ acts as the mean (since the curve is centered around it).

>[!example] Boxcar Kernel
>The Boxcar kernel can be expressed as the piecewise
>$$K_\alpha(x,x_i)=
>\begin{cases}
>\frac{1}{\alpha} & \text{if } |x-x_i| \leq \frac{\alpha}{2} \\
>0 & \text{if else}
>\end{cases}.
