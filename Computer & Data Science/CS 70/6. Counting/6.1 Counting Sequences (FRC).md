>[!note] First Rule of Counting
>If an object can be made by a succession of $k$ choices where the order in which they are made is taken into account, there are $n_1$ ways to make the first choice, and for every first choice there are $n_2$ ways to make the second choice, and for every $n_{k-1}$ choices there are $n_k$ ways to make the $k$th choice, the number of **distinct objects** made by the $k$ choices equates to:
>$$n_1 \times n_2 \times ... \times n_{k-1} \times n_k$$
>**TL;DR:** 
#### Explanation.
The first rule of counting calculates the total number of outcomes available in a sequence of $k$ choices where **order matters**. This means that it works with or without replacement.

>[!example] 
>Consider a standard 52-card deck. We deal 4 cards. At $n_0$ there are 52 cards. After the first one is dealt, there are $n_1= 51$ choices remaining... and so on. This sequence of four choices can be calculated as $n_0 \times n_0 \times n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 = 52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49 = \frac{52!}{(52 - 4)!}$.
