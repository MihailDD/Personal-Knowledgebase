>[!note] Zeroth Rule of Counting
>If a set $A$ can be placed into a one-to-one (bijective) correspondence with a set $B$ and vice-versa, then:
>$$|A|=|B|$$
#### Explanation.
If two sets are equal, then their cardinality is equal.

>[!example] 
>We want to put 6 out of an infinite number of oranges and apples in 4 baskets. The order which we put the fruit in the basket does not matter. We can transform this example into a binomial string, where 1s represent separations between boxes and 0s represent the fruit. An example string is:
>$$011000100$$
>Where (from left to right) there is 1 fruit in first basket, no fruit in the 2nd basket, 3 fruits in the third basket, and 2 fruits in the fourth basket.
>
>Knowing this, we can say that **the total number of choices** is equal to the number of 0s ($k=$fruits) plus the number of 1s ($n=$baskets) - 1. Then, we want to count all the possibilities of placing fruit in each basket where ordering does not matter. We use the SRC (since order doesn't matter) to come up with:
>$$\binom{k+n-1}{k}=\frac{(k+n-1)!}{(n-1)! \times k!}=\frac{9!}{8! \times 4!}$$
