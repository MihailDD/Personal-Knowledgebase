>[!note] Second Rule of Counting
> Let an object be made up of a succession of choices whose order is not taken into account. For an ordered (all objects) set $A$ and an unordered (objects grouped into distinct) set $B$, if there exists a m-to-1 function $f$ from $A$ to $B$:
> $$|B|=\frac{|A|}{m}$$
> Where $m=\frac{|A|}{|B|}$ is the ratio of ordered objects per unordered bin and the function $f$ places the objects in the ordered set $|A|$ into bins in the unordered set $|B|$.
#### Explanation.
The second rule of counting takes the FRC one step further by **disregarding order** in the sampling.

>[!example] 
>Consider the 52-card deck again. We want to find the number of distinct 4-card combinations such that  $\set{7, 14, 3, 1}= \set{1, 14, 3, 7} = ...$ We already know that for an ordered set of a 4-card combination from 52 choices is $|A| = \frac{52!}{48!}$. It also helps to know that there are exactly $4!=24$ ways to arrange the same 4 cards in distinct ways. By the SRC, we conclude that the total number of distinct 4-card combinations is $|B|=\frac{\frac{52!}{48!}}{4!}=\frac{52!}{(52-4)! \times 4!}$ or "52 choose 4".
