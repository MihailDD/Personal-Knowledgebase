>[!note] Measurement Variation
>Measurement variation is the inherent variation that occurs when data collected under identical conditions appears to be different.

>[!example] Measuring Blood Pressure
>We want to estimate the blood pressure of Berkeley students. One student records 122/81 on the first measurement, and 119/82 on the second, taken 2 minutes apart. This difference between blood pressures of the same person is due to measurement error.
