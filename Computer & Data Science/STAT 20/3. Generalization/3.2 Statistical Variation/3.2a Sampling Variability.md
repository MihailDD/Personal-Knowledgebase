>[!note] Sampling Error (Variability)
>Sampling variability refers to the inherent variation that occurs between drawn samples due to the impracticability of utilizing the whole population.

>[!example] Measuring Height
>Again, we want to measure the average height of Berkeley students. However, we can't measure the whole student body (>40,000), since that would take a lot of time and effort. We decide to measure a sample of 50 students 3 times after choosing 5 locations on campus at random. In the first sample, the average height is 5'6. In the second, 5'5. In the third, 5'8. The variance between the 3 sample medians is due to sampling error.
