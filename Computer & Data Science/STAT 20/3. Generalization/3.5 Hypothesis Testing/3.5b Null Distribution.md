>[!note] Null Distribution
>The null distribution is the sampling distribution of a null hypothesis, and is made up of a test statistic. Test statistics may include finding the mean, a difference in proportions, the chi-squared statistic, and others.

>[!example] US v. Gilbert
>In the US v. Gilbert case, it is important to find whether there was any evidence of foul play on Gilbert's side. In order to create our null distribution, we will use a difference in the proportions of deaths when Gilbert was on shift, and when she was not. However, we need to make sure that the data is fully random. In order to do that, we must permute the data set so that any possible dependence between Gilbert being on shift and deaths is removed:
>```R
># Load the Data Frame
>code_blue <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj3grtilupyj9pv/code_blue.csv?dl=1") %>% slice_sample(prop = 1)
>
># Shuffle the response and explanatory variables 5000 times and calculate the null distribution of the difference in proportions between deaths on and off Gilbert's shift 
>null <- code_blue %>% specify(explanatory = staff, response = death, success = "yes") %>% hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% generate(reps = 5000, type = "permute") %>% calculate(stat = "diff in props")
>
># Plot!
>plot(null %>% ggplot(aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram())
>```
