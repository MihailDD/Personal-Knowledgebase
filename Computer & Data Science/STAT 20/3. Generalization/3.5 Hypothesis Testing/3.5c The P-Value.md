>[!note] P-Value
>The p-value is the probability of a test statistic as extreme (or more extreme) than the one observed under the null hypothesis. If the p-value is high, it is consistent with the null hypothesis. If it is very low, it is very unlikely in a real-world scenario, so the null hypothesis can be rejected.

>[!example] USA v. Gilbert
>Before we shuffled the data, the difference in proportion of deaths was $p_{Gilbert} - p_{\text{No Gilbert}} = \frac{40}{257}-\frac{34}{1384}=0.131$. This is a pretty big discrepancy, but we still need to compare it to the null distribution:
>```R
># Load the Data Frame
>code_blue <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj3grtilupyj9pv/code_blue.csv?dl=1") %>% slice_sample(prop = 1)
>
># Shuffle the response and explanatory variables 5000 times and calculate the null distribution of the difference in proportions between deaths on and off Gilbert's shift 
>null <- code_blue %>% specify(explanatory = staff, response = death, success = "yes") %>% hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% generate(reps = 5000, type = "permute") %>% calculate(stat = "diff in props")
>
># Plot!
>plot(null %>% ggplot(aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram(bins = 23) + annotate("segment", x = .131, xend = .131, y = 0, yend = 600, color = "tomato"))
>```
>The difference, highlighted in red on the plot, is nowhere near the null distribution. This means that the p-value is 0, since there are no values larger than 0.131.
