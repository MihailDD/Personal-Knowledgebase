>[!note] Empirical Distribution
>The empirical distribution is a distribution derived from a single sample of the population that is significantly smaller than the population distribution.

>[!example] Restaurants in San Francisco
>Let's say we look at the Yelp pages of 100 restaurants and sample them by recording their 5-star ratings. Then the count of the 100 samples filtered by their number of stars is the empirical distribution:
>```R
>set.seed(123)
>rows <- sample(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), size = 1000, rep = T, prob = c(0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15))
>df <- data.frame(stars = rows)
>sampl_1 <- sample_n(df, size = 10, rep = T)
>sampl_2 <- sample_n(df, size = 50, rep = T)
>p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = stars, y = after_stat(prop))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Population \n Distribution")
>s_1 <- ggplot(sampl_1, aes(x = stars, y = after_stat(prop))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Empirical Distribution 1 \n (n = 10)")
>s_2 <- ggplot(sampl_2, aes(x = stars, y = after_stat(prop))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = paste("Empirical Distribution 2 \n (n = 50)"))
>plot(p + s_1 + s_2)
>```
>As we can see after running the code above, the bigger the sample size, the more the empirical distribution resembles the population distribution. After some calculations we find out that sample one (with n = 10) has a mean and standard deviation of $\bar{x}_1 = 3.90$, $s_1 = 1.29$, whereas sample two (with n = 50) has the statistics $\bar{x}_2 = 3.06$, $s_2 = 1.08$. Therefore sample two comes closer to the population mean and s.d. of $\upmu = 3.28$ and $\upsigma = 1.08$.
