>[!note] Population Distribution
>The population distribution consists of all the members in a population. It is tough to collect data for every member of the population (called a census), so other methods are needed to summarize data.

>[!example] Restaurants in San Francisco
>If we want to eat somewhere in San Francisco, but we want to look at the restaurants' Yelp ratings first, then the ratings of each of all the restaurants in the city will make up the population distribution. Let's say restaurants are rated on a 5-star basis. Then the count of all restaurants in San Francisco on Yelp, separated by the number of stars they have, will make up the population distribution:
>```R
>set.seed(123)
>rows <- sample(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), size = 1000, rep = T, prob = c(0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15))
>df <- data.frame(stars = rows)
>p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = stars, y = after_stat(prop))) + geom_bar()
>plot(p)
>```
>From the plot above, we can conclude that the mean and standard deviation of the distribution are $\upmu = 3.3$ and $\upsigma = 1.1$.
