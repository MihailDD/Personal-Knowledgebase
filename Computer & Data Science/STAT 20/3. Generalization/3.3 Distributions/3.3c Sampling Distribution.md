>[!note] Sampling Distribution
>The sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic (a mean or a median) based on many samples of equal size from the population .

>[!example] Restaurants in San Francisco
>Let's say we sample 100 restaurants at a time, calculate their average rating, and repeat the process 500 times (in STAT 20 this is usually the standard repetition number). We can then make a good inference about the whole population based on our sample. Check this out:
>```R
>set.seed(123)
>rows <- sample(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), size = 1000, rep = T, prob = c(0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15)) 
>df <- data.frame(stars = rows) 
sampl_1 <- data.frame(avg_stars = replicate(500, mean(sample_n(df, size = 10, rep = T)$stars)))
sampl_2 <- data.frame(avg_stars = replicate(500, mean(sample_n(df, size = 100, rep = T)$stars)))
s_1 <- ggplot(sampl_1, aes(x = avg_stars)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Sampling Distribution 1 \n (n = 10 per sample)") 
s_2 <- ggplot(sampl_2, aes(x = avg_stars)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Sampling Distribution 2 \n (n = 100 per sample)") 
>plot(s_1 + s_2)
>```
>All sampling distributions become more normal ($X \enspace \textasciitilde \enspace N(\upmu, \upsigma$) as we increase sample size. This is seen in the second plot, which also has a mean closer to the population distribution ($\upmu=3.3$) than the first plot. Therefore, as we increase sample size, our accuracy increases and our distribution becomes more normal.
