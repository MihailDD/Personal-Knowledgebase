>[!note] Bootstrapping
>Bootstrapping is a method of estimating a sampling distribution using an empirical distribution by (1) turning it into the **Bootstrap population**, (2) sampling the same number of rows from it with replacement, and (3) calculating a sample statistic until enough statistics (usually 10,000 reps) are gathered to form the **Bootstrap sampling distribution**.

>[!example] Restaurants in San Francisco
>Let's go through the process of Bootstrapping step by step. Let's say Yelp is down and we only remember 100 restaurants' 5-star ratings. We want to devise an average rating for all SF restaurants on Yelp. We can write down the ratings we do remember, randomly resample them with replacement and calculate the average rating of each sample. Then, we plot the Bootstrap sampling distribution:
>```R
># Create population (usually we won't be able to do this)
>set.seed(123)
>rows <- sample(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), size = 1000, rep = T, prob = c(0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15)) 
>df <- data.frame(stars = rows) 
>
># Sample from population to create empirical distribution (usually your data set, in this case the 100 restaurants you remember)
>sampl <- data.frame(sample_n(df, size = 100, rep = T))
>
># Utilize the Bootstrapping pipeline (resample and record the average rating of restaurants for each sample)
>bs <- sampl %>% specify(response = stars) %>% generate(reps = 500, type = "bootstrap") %>% calculate(stat = "mean")
>
># Plot!
>bs_sd <- bs %>% ggplot(aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram()
>plot(bs_sd)
>```
