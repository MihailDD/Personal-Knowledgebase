### Intuition
Suppose we have a standard normal distribution $X \space \textasciitilde \space N(0, 1)$. We can calculate the probability of a number or interval as a part of the whole distribution by looking at the area under the curve:

We can see that instead of the observed values, the x-axis records the number of standard deviations each point is from the mean. For example, it turns out that 68% of data falls within -1 and 1 standard deviations from the mean. We see all major intervals below:
- $[-\upsigma, \upsigma] = 0.68$
- $[-1.96\upsigma, 1.96\upsigma] = 0.95$
- $[-2.58\upsigma, 2.58\upsigma] = 0.99$
The multiplicative constant before the standard deviation is known as the z-score.

We have already implicitly defined the confidence interval; it is simply a generalization of the intervals above. We can finally denote for any z-score $z$, $\bar{x}$ standard error $SE(\bar{x})$ of a sampling distribution, $[\bar{x}-z \times SE, \bar{x}+z \times SE]$.
#### Example
>[!example] Restaurants in San Francisco
>Consider our sampling distribution of the average rating of restaurants in San Francisco when sampling 100 restaurants per sample. We can now plot a confidence interval on our plot!
>```R
># Ignore this. Basically creating the population and drawing a sample.
>set.seed(123)
>rows <- sample(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), size = 1000, rep = T, prob = c(0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15)) 
>df <- data.frame(stars = rows) 
>df %>% specify(response = stars) %>% generate(reps = 500, type = "bootstrap") %>% calculate(stat = "mean") %>% get_ci(level = .95)
>```
>Running the example above, we can say with 95% confidence that the population parameter falls between 3.22 and 3.35. This means that 5% of the time a sample from the population will generate a confidence interval which does not contain the population parameter, not that 95% of the time the population parameter falls in that range: think about the population parameter as a constant, and the confidence interval as a variable. Therefore, 5% of all generated confidence intervals from all samples of the population do not contain the population parameter.
