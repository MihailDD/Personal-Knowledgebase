### Intuition
Standard error suggests how much the values of a sampling distribution deviate from the population parameter. When we don't have access to the population distribution, an estimate can be made using an empirical distribution. From the equation above, we can see that as $n$ increases, $SE(\bar{x})$ decreases. This is because as we increase the number of samples $n$, the distribution becomes more condensed around the mean (check [[3.3c Sampling Distribution|3.3c]] for an example of this.
