> [!note] Measurement Bias
> Measurement bias occurs when there is something systematically (consistently) wrong with our measured recordings as compared to their true values.

>[!example]  Measuring Height
>We want to perform a study of the average height of a Berkeley student. We successfully circumvent selection bias, but we don't realize that the ruler we use to measure height is chipped at the bottom, and consistently measures everyone down by 2 inches. Therefore the population mean will go down by 2 inches.
