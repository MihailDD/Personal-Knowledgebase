>Selection bias occurs when a sample is not representative of the whole population.

>[!example] Summarizing Pimentel
>We want to devise a population parameter of what year most students in STAT 20 are. However, the professor only chooses people that sit in the front rows of the lecture hall. This is not random, since it might turn out that first-year students are more likely to sit in the front rows. Therefore, the sample mode will be more skewed towards first-years.
