### Intuition
The residual sum of squares formula calculates all the squared residuals within $n$ between the actual y-value ($y_i$) and the y-value predicted by the linear model ($\hat{y}_i$). It essentially is a measure of the model error, since the larger the residuals between each $i \to n$, the larger the RSS.
