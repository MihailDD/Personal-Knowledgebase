>[!note] Joint Distribution
>The joint distribution of two [[2.1 Random Variables|random variables]] is a collection of values,
>$$\set{((a,b),\mathbb{P}[X=a,Y=b]):a \in \mathscr{A}, b \in \mathscr{B}},$$
>where $\mathscr{A}$ is the set of all possible values of $X$, and $\mathscr{B}$ is the set of all possible values of $Y$.

>[!note] Marginal Distribution
>When given a joint distribution, the marginal distribution for a variable $X$ is found by summing over the possibilities of Y:
>$$\mathbb{P}[X=a]=\sum^{}_{b \in \mathscr{B}}\mathbb{P}[X=a, Y=b].$$
