#### Explanation
The Binomial distribution is an elaboration of the [[4.2a Bernoulli Distribution|Bernoulli]] for multiple trials. For an event with probability $p$, it either happens (with probability $p$ and count $i$) or it doesn't happen (with probability $1-p$ and count $n-i$) in each of $n$ trials.
