#### Explanation.
We want to draw $n$ balls from a box of $N=B+W$ balls without replacement. Consider a case of a sequence $\upomega$ of n draws where the first $k$ balls are black and the next $n-k$ balls are white. Then, the probability of this particular sequence will be:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}[\upomega] &= \frac{B}{N} \times \frac{B-1}{N-1} \times...\times \frac{B-k+1}{N-k+1} \times \frac{W}{N-k} \times \frac{W-1}{N-k-1} \times...\times \frac{W-(n-k)+1}{N-n+1} \\ &= \frac{\frac{B!}{(B-k)!}\frac{W!}{(W-(n-k))!}}{\frac{N}{(N-n)!}} \\ &= \frac{\frac{B!}{(B-k)!}\frac{(N-B)!}{(N-B-(n-k))!}}{\frac{N}{(N-n)!}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
Because of this, each sample point of a Hypergeometric [[4.1 Distribution|distribution]] can be viewed as binomial without repetition.

Now, in order to find all distinct sequences with $n$ draws of $k$ black balls and $n-k$ white balls, we need to multiply by $\binom{n}{k}$, leading to:
$$\mathbb{P}[X=k]=\binom{n}{k}\frac{\frac{B!}{(B-k)!}\frac{(N-B)!}{(N-B-(n-k))!}}{\frac{N}{(N-n)!}}=\frac{\binom{B}{k}\binom{N-B}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
If we had white, black and orange balls, then we need another variable, say $j$, for the number of draws of white balls, and the rest would go to orange.
