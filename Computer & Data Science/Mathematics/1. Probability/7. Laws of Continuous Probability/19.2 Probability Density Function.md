>[!note] PDF
>A probability density function for a continuous random variable $X$ is a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:
>1. $f$ is non-negative: $f(x) \geq 0$  $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$
>2. The total integral of $f$ is equal to 1: $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(x)dx=1$
>
>Then the distribution of $X$ is given by:
>$$\mathbb{P}[a \leq X \leq b]=\int^{b}_{a}f(x)dx.$$

#### Intuition
A PDF is in no way related to getting the probability of a variable $x$. It doesn't even have to be bounded by 1.  To connect density with probabilities, we have to look at an interval $\mathbb{P}[a \leq X \leq B]$ of the PDF.

#### Example
>[!example] Wheel of Fortune
>Consider a wheel of fortune on the interval $[0,\mathscr{l}]$ where $\mathscr{l}$ is the circumference of the circle. Outside of the interval, $f(x)=0$. However, under the interval, we want $f$ to be uniform, and therefore $f(x)=c$ for all $x$. Therefore,
>$$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(x)dx=\int^{\mathscr{l}}_{0}cdx=c \mathscr{l}=1.$$
>which gives us $c=\frac{1}{\mathscr{l}}$. We can now model the PDF of the wheel of fortune as:
>$$
>f(x)=
>\begin{cases}
>0 & x < 0 \\
>\frac{1}{\mathscr{l}} & 0 \leq x \leq \mathscr{l} \\
>0 & x > \mathscr{l}
\end{cases}
>$$
