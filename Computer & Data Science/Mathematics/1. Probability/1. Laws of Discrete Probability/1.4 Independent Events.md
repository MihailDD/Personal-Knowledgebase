#### Explanation.
Pairwise independence and mutual independence of events in the same [[1.1 Probability Space|probability space]] imply the independence of $n=2$ and $n \geq 2$ events accordingly. Note that **pairwise independent events may not be mutually independent**.

>[!example] Pairwise Independent but Not Mutually Independent
>Suppose you flip a fair coin twice. Let three events be:
>- A: The first flip is heads.
>- B: The second flip is heads.
>- C: Both flips are the same (HH or TT).
>
>The first and the second events are independent. So are the first and the third, since $\mathbb{P}[A \cap C]=\mathbb{P}[A]\mathbb{P}[C]=\frac{1}{4}$.

>However, these events are not mutually independent: if we are given that A and B occurred, the probability of C occurring is 1. These events are independent by pairs, but not mutually.
