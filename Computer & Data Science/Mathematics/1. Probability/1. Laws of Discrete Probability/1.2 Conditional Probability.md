#### Explanation.
For an event A, $\mathbb{P}[A]=\sum^{}_{\upomega \in A}\mathbb{P}[\upomega]$. That is, the probability of event A is the sum of all sample points in A (such as A = {(H, H, T), (T, H, T)}, and each sample point is each element in A). Now, in order to calculate the probability of event A happening when event B in the same [[1.1 Probability Space|probability space]] has already happened, we need to normalize the probability of each sample point in A by $\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}[B]}$ Knowing this, we can write:
$$\mathbb{P}[\upomega|B]=\frac{\mathbb{P}[\upomega]}{\mathbb{P}[B]}$$
Given this normalization, we can write:
$$\mathbb{P}[A|B]=\sum^{}_{\upomega \in A \cap B}\mathbb{P}[\upomega|B]=\sum^{}_{\upomega \in A \cap B}\frac{\mathbb{P}[\upomega]}{\mathbb{P}[B]}=\frac{\mathbb{P}[A \cap B]}{\mathbb{P}[B]}$$

>[!example] Card Dealing
>What would the probability that when dealing two cards, and the first one is known to be an ace ($A_1$), the second one is also an ace ($A_2$)? Then $\mathbb{P}[A_2|A_1]=\frac{\mathbb{P}[A_2 \cap A_1]}{\mathbb{P}[A_1]}$. We can easily calculate $\mathbb{P}[A_1]=\frac{4}{52}$ and $\mathbb{P}[A_2 \cap A_1]=\frac{4}{52}\frac{3}{51}$. Then,
>$$\mathbb{P}[A_2|B_1]=\frac{\frac{4}{52}\frac{3}{51}}{\frac{4}{52}}=\frac{3}{51}$$
