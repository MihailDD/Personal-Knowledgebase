>[!note] Mutually Exclusive Events
>If events $A_1,...,A_n$ are mutually exclusive ($A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$), then
>$$\mathbb{P}[\cup_{i=1}^nA_i]=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{P}[A_i]$$
#### Explanation.
The MEE theorem is a simplification of the [[1.6 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle|inclusion-exclusion principle]] that deals with disjoint events (such that cannot happen at the same time).
