#### Explanation.
The inclusion-exclusion principle is a fool-proof way to exclude repeating elements in distinct sets used in combinatorics. Here, it works with probabilities by disregarding repeating sample points in different events in the same [[1.1 Probability Space|probability space]]. Using two events A and B, this leads to $\mathbb{P}[A \cup B] = \mathbb{P}[A]+\mathbb{P}[B]-\mathbb{P}[A \cap B]$, a well-known definition of a union of two events.

>[!example] A Night in Las Vegas
>Casinos advertise the probability of rolling your number on a fair 6-sided die in 3 rolls as $\mathbb{P}[A \cup B \cup C]=3 \times \frac{1}{6}$. Is this correct? No. The casino is not using the inclusion-exclusion principle, since there may be cases where A and B, or A and C, or B and C, or A, B, and C happen. Therefore, the actual probability is:

>\begin{equation}
>\begin{aligned}
>\mathbb{P}[A \cup B \cup C] &= \mathbb{P}[A]+\mathbb{P}[B]+\mathbb{P}[C] - \\ & - \mathbb{P}[A \cap B]-\mathbb{P}[A \cap C]-\mathbb{P}[B \cap C] + \\ &  + \mathbb{P}[A \cap B \cap C] \approx 0.42

\end{equation}

>This can also be represented using the following diagram of a probability space:

>\begin{document}
>\begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
>\draw[] (0, 0) ellipse (4.25 and 2.25) node[left]{};
>\draw[] (0, 0.5) circle (1) node[above]{$A$};
>\draw[] (-0.6, -0.5) circle (1) node[below]{$B$};
>\draw[] (0.4, -0.5) circle (1) node[below]{$C$};
>\draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,-1.6) node[below]{$A \cap B \cap C$};
>\end{tikzpicture}
>\end{document}

>The 3 events overlap 3 times ($A \cap B$, $B \cap C$, $C \cap A$). Therefore, the pairwise intersections of all events have to be removed. After this, a hole is left in the middle, which is filled by the intersection of all 3 events ($A \cap B \cap C$).
