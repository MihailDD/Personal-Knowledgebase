> [!note] Chain (Product) Rule
> For any events $A_1, ..., A_n$,
> $$\mathbb{P}[\cap_{i = 1}^nA_i]=\mathbb{P}[A_1] \times \mathbb{P}[A_2 | A_1] \times \mathbb{P}[A_3 | A_1 \cap A_2] \times ... \times \mathbb{P}[A_n | \cap_{i = 1}^{n-1}A_i]$$
#### Intuition. 
The chain rule is a generalization of the [[1.4 Independent Events|rule of independence]] for both independent and dependent events. This can be confirmed by the following:

#### Example.
>[!example] Monty Hall Revisited
>Let's figure out the Monty Hall problem using another set of events. For a set $I = {1, 2, 3}$
>- $C_i$ is the event that the contestant chooses door $i \in I$.
>- $P_i$ is the event that the prize is behind door $i \in I$.
>- $H_i$ is the event that the host opens door $i \in I$.
>
>Considering the rules from the previous instance, what is the probability of $C_1,$ $P_2,$ and $H_3$? We have:
>$$\mathbb{P}[C_1 \cap P_2 \cap H_3]=\mathbb{P}[C_1] \times \mathbb{P}[P_2 | C_1] \times \mathbb{P}[H_3 | C_1 \cap P_2]$$
>Which is equal to $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.
>Note that if the contestant chooses the same door that the prize is behind, then $\mathbb{P}[C_1 \cap P_2 \cap H_3]=\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{18}$ Since the host has two doors with goats to pick from.

>Going back to the original question, noting that $\mathbb{P}[C_1 \cap H_3]=\mathbb{P}[C_1] \times \mathbb{P}[H_3 | C_1]=\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$,
>$$\mathbb{P}[P_2 | C_1 \cap H_3] = \frac{\mathbb{P}[C_1 \cap P_2 \cap H_3]}{\mathbb{P}[C_1 \cap H_3]}=\frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{6}}=\frac{2}{3}.$$
