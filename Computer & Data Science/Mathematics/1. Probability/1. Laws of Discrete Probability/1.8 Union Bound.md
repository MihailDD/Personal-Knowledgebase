>[!note] Union Bound
>For events $A_1,...,A_n$ in the same probability space, then for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$,
>$$\mathbb{P}[\cup_{i=1}^nA_i] \leq \sum^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{P}[A_i]$$
#### Explanation.
The union bound inequality states that adding every $\mathbb{P}[A_i]$ can only be equal to (in the case of [[1.7 Disjoint Union|mutually exclusive events]]), or overstate (such as in [[1.6 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle|dependent events]]) the probability of the union.
