>[!note] Variance for General Random Variables
>The variance of two general (not independent) random variables $X$ and $Y$ equals,
>$$Var(c_1X+c_2Y)=c_1^2Var(X)+c_2^2Var(Y)+2c_1c_2(Cov(X,Y)).$$
#### Explanation.
Now that we have defined both [[3.3b Linearity of Variance|variance]] for independent random variables, and [[3.4 Covariance|covariance]] for general random variables, we can redefine the definition of variance by substituting the proof in 16.3b with covariance.
