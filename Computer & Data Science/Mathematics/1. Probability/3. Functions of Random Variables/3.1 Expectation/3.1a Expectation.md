>[!note] Expectation
>The expectation of a discrete random variable $X$ is defined as,
>$$\mathbb{E}[X]=\sum^{}_{a \in \mathscr{A}}a \times \mathbb{P}[X=a],$$
>where $\mathscr{A}$ is the set of values that $X$ can take.
#### Explanation.
The expectation can be seen as the average or median of a probability distribution. It is the most expected value given all probabilities of a [[2.1 Random Variables|random variable]].

>[!example] Roulette
>Suppose you are playing roulette. Recall that a roulette has 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, 2 green (0 and 00). You bet \$1 on black. Then the probability of you winning is $\frac{18}{38} \approx 0.47$. Let $X$ be your net winnings in a single game. You can either win \$1, or lose \$1. Then your expected winnings per game are 
>$$\mathbb{E}[X]=\left(1 \times \frac{18}{38}\right) + \left(- 1 \times \frac{20}{38}\right)=-\frac{1}{19}.$$
>Therefore, you lose about a nickel with every game of roulette you play.
