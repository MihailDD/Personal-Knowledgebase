#### Explanation.
Remember the proof of the [[3.3b Linearity of Variance|linearity of variance]], where we canceled the term $2c_1c_2(\mathbb{E}[XY]-\mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y])$ because the two variables are independent (and therefore $\mathbb{E}[XY]=\mathbb{E}[X]\mathbb{E}[Y]$)? Well, this turns out to be the definition of covariance.
