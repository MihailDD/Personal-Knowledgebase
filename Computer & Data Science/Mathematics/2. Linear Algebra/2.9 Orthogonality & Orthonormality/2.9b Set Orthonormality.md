# Intuition
The above equation is equivalent to saying that:
1. All $n^2$ pairs of vectors $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in S \in \vec{R}^n$ are [[2.9 Orthogonality|orthogonal]].
2. All $n$ vectors in $S$ are in unit norm ($\left<\vec{x},\vec{y}\right>=||\vec{x}||^2=||\vec{y}||^2=1$).
Essentially, a set is orthonormal if it is orthogonal AND all of its vectors are normalized. This goes one step further and is useful for ...
