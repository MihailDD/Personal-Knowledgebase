# Intuition
Essentially, the above theorem may be translated into [[2.9b Set Orthonormality|set orthonormality]]:
- A tall matrix has orthonormal columns $\iff$ its column vectors form an orthonormal set.
- A wide matrix has orthonormal rows $\iff$ its row vectors form an orthonormal set.
- A square matrix is orthonormal $\iff$ both its row and column vectors form orthonormal sets.
