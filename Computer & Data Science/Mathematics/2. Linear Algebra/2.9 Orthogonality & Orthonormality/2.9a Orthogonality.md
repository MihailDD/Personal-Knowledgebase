>[!note] Orthogonality of Sets
>A set of vectors $S \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is **pairwise orthogonal** if and only if every pair of vectors  $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in S$ is pairwise orthogonal such that
>$$\left<\vec{x},\vec{y}\right>=0.$$
>If $S$ is orthogonal, then it is linearly independent and contains at most $\leq n$ vectors.
>
>Two sets of vectors $S_1$ and $S_2$ are **orthogonal to each other** if:
>- All pairs $\vec{x} \in S_1$ and $\vec{y} \in S_2$ are orthogonal.
>- The bases $B_1$ and $B_2$ of $S_1$ and $S_2$ are orthogonal to each other.
