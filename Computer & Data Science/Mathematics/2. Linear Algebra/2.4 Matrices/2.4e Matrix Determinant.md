# Intuition
Geometrically, the absolute value of the determinant of a square matrix essentially provides us with the ==amount of n-dimensional space that the column vectors of the matrix take up==. In 2D space, this is area. In 3D space, this is volume. The sign of the determinant shows ==whether the vector space is flipped with respect to the unit vectors==. If the determinant is zero, this means that at least one of the column vectors of the matrix is linearly dependent, and all the vectors are on a single line with an area of 0.

When applied to another structure such as a vector or a matrix, the determinant ==indicates the scaling factor of the area/volume== of the product of the transformation relative to the original structure.

# Example
>[!example] Determinant as Area and Magnitude
>Consider the square matrix $A=\begin{bmatrix}2 & -4 \\ 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$. We can plot its vectors on  2D cartesian space as $\vec{a}_1=\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{a}_2=\begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}$:

>We then get $\det(A)=8$. We can interpret this as either:
>- The area of the space made up by the column vectors of $A$ is 8.
>- The matrix $A$ scales the area of the $2 \times 2$ identity matrix by a factor of 8.

Since the area of the parallelogram is  positive, the vector space orientation has not flipped.

Let's now swap the rows and columns of each vector of $A$ (note that this is not the transpose and that $\det(A)=\det(A^{T})$) as $B=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 2 & -4\end{bmatrix}$. Then, $\vec{b}_1=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{b}_2=\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ -4\end{bmatrix}$. Plotting this in Cartesian space leads us to

>with $\det(B)=-8$. How are the two plots different? Matrix B, with a negative determinant, appears to have flipped the column vectors of $I$ such that $\vec{b}_1$ is the leftmost (usually where the $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ unit vector is) and $\vec{b}_2$ is the rightmost (where the $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ unit vector is). As such, the transformation of $B$ applied to $I$ has flipped the vector space.
