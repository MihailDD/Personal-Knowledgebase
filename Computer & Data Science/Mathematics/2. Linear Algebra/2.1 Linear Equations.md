>[!note] Linear Equation
>A linear equation with unknown scalars $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is an equation where each side is a sum of scalar-valued linear functions $f(\alpha x)=\alpha f(x)$ of each of the unknowns plus a scalar constant $b$ and is of the form
>$$f_1(x_1)+...+f_n(x_n)+b_f=g_1(x_1)+...+g_n(x_n)+b_n \iff \alpha_1 x_1 + ... + \alpha_n x_n + b_f = \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n + b_g$$
>where each side of the equations is a *linear combination* of $x_i$.
