# Proof
We start the approximation process by letting the [[2.1a Discrete-Time LTI Model|discrete-time]] $\vec{x}_d[i]$ be made up of traces of length $\Updelta t$. This means that we will be working with quantities like $\vec{x}_d[2]=\vec{x}_c(2\Updelta t)$. As such, we can use the traced states for the discrete timestep $i \in \mathbb{N}$:
$$
\vec{x}_d[i]:=\vec{x}_c(i \Updelta t)
$$
$$\vec{u}_d[i]:=\vec{u}_c(i \Updelta t).$$
Knowing that our [[2.1b Continuous-Time LTI Model(s)|continuous-time model]] obeys the equation $\frac{d}{dt}\vec{x}_c(t)=A_c\vec{x}_c(t)+B_c\vec{u}_c(t)$, we can try to approximate our system by finding $A_d \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $B_d \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ such that
$$\vec{x}_d[i+1]=A_d \vec{x}_d[i]+B_d \vec{u}_d[i] \iff \vec{x}_c((i+1)\Updelta t)=A_d\vec{x}_c(i\Updelta t)+B_d\vec{u}_c(i\Updelta t).$$
Unfortunately, here we are met with a problem, since we cannot know for sure how the control inputs $\vec{u}_c(t)$ will behave in the traces $\vec{u}_d[i]$ and $\vec{u}_d[i]$, or equivalently in the interval $(i\Updelta t, i\Updelta t + 1)$. This will lead to a solution with coefficients $A_d$ and $B_d$ that to not equal $\vec{x}_d[i+1]$ when multiplied by $\vec{x}_d[i]$ and $\vec{u}_d[i]$. To fix this, we introduce $\vec{u}_c$ as a piecewise constant where
$$
\begin{aligned}
\vec{u}_c(t)=\vec{u}_c(i \Updelta t)=\vec{u}_d[i] && \forall t \in [i\Updelta t, (i+1)\Updelta t).
\end{aligned}
$$
This assumption is referred to as a **zero-order hold assumption**, since the input is a zero-order polynomial in time (i.e. a piecewise constant).
