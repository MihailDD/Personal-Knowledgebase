>[!note] Stored Energy of an Inductor
>The stored energy $E_L$ of an [[2.1i.1 Inductor|inductor]] can be written as
>$$E_L=\frac{1}{2}LI_L(t)^2.$$

# Proof
Since we already know that $P=IV$ and that power is the time-integral of energy (work), we can substitute $V_L=L \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt}$: $$P_L= LI_L(t) \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt}.$$We then manipulate and integrate:
$$\int P_Ldt= L \int I_L(t) dI_L(t).$$
Completing the integration we get:
$$E=\frac{1}{2}LI_L(t)^2.$$
