In fruit flies, reproductive fitness and mating success are more variable in males compared to females. Also in males, fertility increased more steeply with the number of males as opposed to females. This observed male bias in sexual selection arises from anisogamy (differences between gamete size and number). 

Why? Male organisms simply have more sex cells. They can reproduce at faster rates, and can mate with multiple females at once. On the other hand, female organisms can only bear one male's offspring at a time.

Bateman's ideas highlighted that, in many species, males are more likely to benefit reproductively from **mating with multiple partners**, while females are more likely to **benefit from quality over quantity** in mate selection. This results in female-biased parental care and male-biased elaboration of traits (dichotomy).
