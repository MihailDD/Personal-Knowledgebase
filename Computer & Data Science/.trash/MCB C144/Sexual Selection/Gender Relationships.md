There are two forms of sexual selection,

**Intra-sexual selection** involves members of the same gender competing for access to mates. Usually males fighting using antlers, etc. which do not result in major injuries but establish dominance in polygynous mating systems (many females and one male) such as in chicken.

**Inter-sexual selection** involves a member of one gender choosing their mates. Usually females, these individuals choose their males based on traits that they fancy.
