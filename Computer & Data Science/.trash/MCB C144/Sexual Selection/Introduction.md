**Sexual selection** is a process in which individuals with certain heritable traits are more likely to obtain mates and have offspring because of them.

It is a result of **sexual dimorphism**, a difference in a **secondary sexual characteristic** (not related to reproduction as **primary**, but related to attraction) between males and females of the same species.
