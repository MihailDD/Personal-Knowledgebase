>[!note] Motoo Kimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution
>Made a prediction that for fitness-neutral mutations there will be a constant mutation rate. This is because Kimura found that the rate of new neutral mutations was equal to the rate of fixation (all members of a species have only that allele at that locus) of neutral mutations within the species as a whole. Then:
>1. $\mathbb{P}[\text{fixation of allele A}]=\frac{1}{2N}$
>2. If a new neutral mutation goes to fixation (all members of a species have only that allele at that locus), then a substitution occurs. Let the rate of fixation of neutral mutations (substitution rate) between an ancestor and its speciation  be $k$.
>3. Because there are $2N$ gene copies for diploid organisms, the number of new neutral mutations per generation is $2N \upmu$, where $\upmu$ is the mutation rate per individual per generation.
>4. Each new neutral mutation has an initial frequency of $\frac{1}{2N}$, so the expected number of neutral mutations going to fixation each generation is simply $k=2N \upmu \frac{1}{2N}=\upmu$
