>[!note] There are 4 observations that suggest co-evolution occurs in nature.
>1. There is tight correspondence between features of the co-evolving species (cuckoos adapting their eggs to host egg colors, sphinx moths adapting their tongues to pollinate orchids).
>2. Co-Evolving Escape-and-Radiate Hypothesis:
>	1. Plants are attacked by insects, and selection evolves toxins to "escape".
>	2. Plants with toxins increase in abundance and "radiate".
>	3. Insect lineage evolves resistance to toxins and "escapes".
>	4. Insect lineage increases in abudnance and "radiates".
>	5. Back to 1.
>3. Co-evolving species exhibit phylogenies that are highly congruent (especially in symbiotic relationships where host-parasite both benefit).
>4. Co-evolving species will exhibit complementary sets of capabilities (symbiotic relationships).

>[!example] Example for 2.
>Pierid butterflies evolved the nitrile specifier protein (NSP), which allowed them to feed on mustard oil from the *Brassicaceae* family, disarming the mustard oil bomb while eating the mustards.
