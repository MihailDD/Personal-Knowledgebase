>[!note] Co-Evolution
>For co-evolution to occur, there must be:
>1. Genetic variation for characters in both species that influence their interactions.
>2. Each species must affect selection in the other species.
>3. There must be response to selection in each species.

>[!example] 
>Common cuckoos match the host bird's eggs' patterns so they aren't recognized in their nests. Different family lines 'gentes' result in different cuckoo genotypes that determine which type of bird their eggs will match. Then the host birds will raise the cuckoo chicks as their own, while the cuckoo chicks themselves will push host eggs out of the nest in order to not be detected.

**Reciprocal Genetic Change** is a process where two or more ecologically interacting species drive evolutionary change.
