In haplodiploid species, where females are diploid (a product of a fertilized egg and sperm) and males are haploid (a product of unfertilized eggs). This results in highly skewed relatedness patterns between sexes in families.

This is because **sisters are more closely related to each other than they are to their mothers or daughters.**
