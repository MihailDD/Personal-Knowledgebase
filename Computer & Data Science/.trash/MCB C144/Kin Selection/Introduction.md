**Inclusive (total) fitness** is the sum of direct and indirect fitness:
1. **Direct fitness** is the fitness resulting from solely reproduction.
2. **Indirect fitness** is the additional fitness made possible by the actions of another (relatives or kin).

We already know how direct fitness is increased. However, indirect fitness is increased using **kin selection**.

What is that? It is a special kind of natural selection where **altruism** (acting beneficial at your expense) is directed at close relatives who share genes with the altruistic individual.

>[!example] Workers in a Colony
>Insects like ants, bees, termites, wasps often have worker individuals that are sterile (since their developmental fate was sealed by the type of food they received during development). Their main task is to help their kin reproduce directly.

However, these instances of altruism in helper species only arise when the product of relatedness x benefit (of recipient) outweighs the cost of the actor to perform the altruistic behavior. This is because if relatedness is high, the recipient is more likely to carry the "helping" allele, causing it to increase in frequency.
