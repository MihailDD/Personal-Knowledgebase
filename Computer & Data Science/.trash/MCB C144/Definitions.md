**Convergent evolution** happens when the same traits occur independently in unrelated species.

**Total phenotypic variance** is calculated as $V_P=V_G+V_E+V_{G \times E}$ where $V_G$ is total genotypic variance ($V_G=V_A+V_I+V_D$), $V_E$ is total environmental variance, and $V_{G \times E}$ is the variance of the interaction between the two.

**Narrow-sense heritability** ($h^2=\frac{V_A}{V_P}$) (not squared, just 2) is a measure that tells us the proportion of the total genotypic variance ($V_P$) of a trait in populations that is a result of predictable genetic differences (**additive genetic variance** $V_A$).
