#### Sexual Selection
>[!question] What did Nancy Burley’s experiments on finches and Alexandra Bosolo’s experiments on platys and swordtails illuminate?
>These two experiments illuminated on sensory bias in these populations; aesthetic factors play a big role in females choosing their sexual partner and may be inherent rather than based on exposure. 

>[!question] What are Bateman gradients and describe how a recent study across many different species supported or didn’t line up with this idea. Define anisogamy in your answer.
>The Bateman gradient is the slope of the relationship between number of mates and number of offspring in members of a population. Due to the difference in the count of male and female gametes of most sexually reproductive species called anisogamy, the Bateman gradient in males appears to be steeper (stronger) than in females. Because of males' easier ability to produce offspring, sexual selection works stronger on males, which creates the need for sexual dimorphism in them (elaborated secondary sexual characteristics). Females, on the other hand, are more invested in their offspring, a term called parental care. A study by Janicke et al. supported this theory, since the variance of the Bateman gradient in most animals was male-biased.


#### Kin Evolution
>[!question] Define Hamilton’s rule and determine whether an allele for cooperative behavior would spread through natural selection if relatedness between actor and recipient is 0.3, the benefit to the recipient is 6 offspring and the cost to the actor is 2 offspring.
>Hamilton's rule suggests that the closer the relative is to the actor and the bigger the benefit to recipient is compared to the cost of the actor, the more likely it is for the actor to engage in altruistic behavior in order to spread the altruistic allele. This can be described by the equation $c < R \times b$. Therefore, $2 < 1.8$, so the actor is unlikely to engage in altruism for the recipient.

>[!question] Why is it that Hymenoptera seem to be particularly prone to evolve eusociality (and use the concept of super sisters in your answer)?
>Hymenoptera are haplodiploid, since males are born using unfertilized eggs. This means that males are only used to create other females. By Hamilton's rule, the relativeness between super sisters is higher (75%), and therefore altruism is more likely to evolve in females.

> [!question] Why are 50-50 sex ratios maintained in natural populations?
> If otherwise, one sex would be abundant over the other, and the offspring from them will balance out the advantage.
#### Neutral & Nearly Neutral Theory
>[!question] What is Fisher’s Geometric model of adaptation and how does the analogy of the microscope apply to it?
>Fisher's Geometric model states populations must adapt to an ever-changing environment to reach maximum fitness. Fisher uses the analogy of coarse and fine knobs of a microscope to suggest that as populations reach their average fitness peak, small changes (using the fine knob) are much more likely to improve their fitness over large changes (using the coarse knob).

>[!question] Describe Kimura’s main contribution using words and derive the simple mathematical equivalency that forms the basis of this contribution.
>Kimura's main contribution is the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, which states that mutations that have a neutral impact on species' fitness will have a constant mutation rate that equals the substitution rate between species. In math terms, $k=\upmu$, where $k$ is the constant rate of substitution (new neutral mutations between species) and $\upmu$ is the constant rate of new neutral mutations per individual per generation.
>
>This is derived from $k=2N \upmu \frac{1}{2N}$, where $2N \upmu$ is the number of new neutral mutations in the generation, and $\frac{1}{2N}$ is the probability of fixation of a new mutation in the generation.

>[!question] Describe the molecular clock and how it links mutation rate within a population with substitution rates between populations.
>The molecular clock means that within a population there is a constant mutation rate. Since mutation rate is constant within a population, so is the substitution rate between populations by $k=\upmu$.

>[!question] Why is it that a dominant beneficial mutation may never ever go to fixation in a population?
>Beneficial mutations are vanishingly rare, so the ones that appear 

>[!question] Will selection or drift govern the fate of a new mutation if the effective population size is 1,000,000 and the selection coefficient is 0.001? What about if the effective population size is the same but the selection coefficient is 0.000000000001? Who came up with the idea of effective neutrality (that drift drives fixation of slightly deleterious mutations)?
>Kimura and Ohta came up with this idea. For an effective population size of 1m, 0.001x1m = 1000 > 1, so natural selection will govern the fate of a new mutation. For the second selection coefficient, the product < 1, so genetic drift is the governing force.

>[!question] How can it be that orangutans have a larger effective population size and fewer *Alu* inserts per genome than humans?
>Since orangutans have a larger effective population than humans, the mutation rate of *Alu* inserts considered slightly deleterious is lower since it is less governed by genetic drift as opposed to in humans.

>[!question] Define the mutational hazard hypothesis for genome evolution and describe the evolution of introns.
>The mutational hazard hypothesis states that variation in $N_e$ over deep evolutionary time led to the appearance of introns in eukaryotic genomes.


#### Gene Duplication
>[!question] What are meiotic drivers and autosomal suppressors and how do they relate to one another?

#### Speciations & Isolating Mechanisms
>[!question] What is the biological species concept and who created it?
>**Ernst Mayr**'s biological species concept states that species are populations that can no longer easily interbreed.

>[!question] Explain how the Galapagos hawk evolved using your knowledge of their biology as concepts of speciation.
>The Galapagos hawk deviated from its ancestral species due to the large water barriers between mainland South America and the Galapagos. Only a handful of a population of the ancestral species migrated to the Galapagos. This resulted in peripatric speciation, or the divergence of a new species due to complete isolation from the larger population, since the ancestral hawks had to adapt to their new environment while gene flow was cut off.

>[!question] What general type of isolating mechanisms are operating in the below (two-part) and describe the situation biologically as specifically as possible:
>1. Post-zygotic barrier: A horse and donkey's offspring, a mule, cannot reproduce since it has an odd number of chromosomes.
>2. Pre-zygotic barrier: male color mattered to females resulting in sexual selection.

>[!question] What did the experiment by Dodd (1989) show and why was this important for our understanding of speciation?
