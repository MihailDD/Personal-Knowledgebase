We already talked about Hopi Hoekstra and his research on beach mice in discussion.

The oldfield mice vary in color across Florida: they are darker on the mainland and lighter on the coral sands off the coast. There are two genes responsible for the light mice mutation in Gulf Coast mice: *Mc1r* and *Agouti*, both in the melanin pathway.

However, sequencing Atlantic Coast light mice and mainland mice, there is no discernible difference between those same genes. This means that in the Atlantic Coast population there seems to be something else that causes light colored hair.

Thus, lightness evolves twice due to : enter convergent evolution.

What can that tell us about the narrow-sense heredity of light mice?
