Darwin did not recognize that the finches of the Galapagos were all the same species. It wasn't until scientist John Gould pointed out that these birds might have a common ancestor that Darwin started to believe in natural selection.

Competition for resources leads to adaptation and eventual extinction of less fit ancestral genotypes. Therefore, the lives of the Galapagos finches are mainly governed by what food, and how much, is available for them. This is how population sizes are determined.

Peter and Rosemary Grant did further research on the Galapagos finches. Since bill depth and shape variation is mostly derived from additive genetic variation, these two traits can be pushed around by natural selection (there is an abundance of different seeds ad fruit on the Galapagos, some bigger, some smaller, so no matter what the beak shape there will mostly always be available food).

For this reason, there was no competition between finches in the first half of 1977. Then, there was a drought, which dramatically increased competition, leading to species specializing between seeds.

The survivors of the 1977 drought had a larger mean beak ($9.9$mm) than the total population pre-drought ($9.2$mm). This resulted in an increase of average beak size in offspring of $R=0.63$. This is the result of the formula $R=S \times h^2$, where $S=9.9-9.2=0.7$ is the selection differential and $h^2=0.9$ is the narrow sense heritability for beak length (hence additive genetic variance is responsible for 90% of total phenotypic variance).
