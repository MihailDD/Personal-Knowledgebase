>[!note] What is Fisherâ€™s Geometric model of adaptation and how does the analogy of the microscope apply to it?
>Fisher's Geometric Model of Adaptation has 3 features. Mainly,
>1. Populations must adapt to their environment using mutations that are uniformly random with respect to the needs of organisms.
>2. These mutations have different phenotypic 'sizes' *(some are vectors of large magnitude, while others are vectors of small magnitude)*.
>3. Populations must adapt in the face of **pleiotropy** (a mutation that affects many traits and may improve one trait while worsening many others).
>
>It may be inferred from the model that small-effect mutations are more likely to benefit organism fitness than large-scale mutation.

>**Microscope:** Fisher used the focus knobs of a microscope as an analogy. Big adjustments are like the coarse-knob, while smaller adjustments are like the fine knob. As you get closer to your desired location (in this instance the fitness peak), it becomes riskier to make changes using the coarse knob and therefore the fine knob should be used. This is the law of diminishing returns, where the slope of fitness increases at a decreasing rate.

Basically, certain alleles are favored by natural selection because they increase the performance of a functional trait, and therefore organism fitness is increased.
