# Explanation
This is pretty simple if we regard the formula above as an equation of two linear functions $f_i$ and $g_i$, where
$$f_1(x_1)+f_2(x_2)+...+f_n(x_n)+b_f=g_1(x_1)+g_2(x_2)+...+g_n(x_n)+b_g$$
Over each term of $x$ is applied a certain (linear) transformation, usually a constant. We can expand this equation even further by equating $f_i(x_i)=\alpha_i x_i$. and $g_i(x_i)=\beta_ix_i$. We then have:$$\alpha_1x_1+\alpha_2x_2+...+\alpha_nx_n=\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+...+\beta_nx_n+b_g$$This suggests that a linear equation (1) is equal to two linear combinations (in this case the LHS and RHS of the 2nd equation).
