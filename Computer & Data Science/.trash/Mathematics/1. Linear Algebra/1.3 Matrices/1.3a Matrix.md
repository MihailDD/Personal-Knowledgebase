# Explanation
Tuff, leave for later 

# Example
>[!example] Water Reservoirs
>Imagine a city with 3 water reservoirs, labeled A, B, and C. Each day, $\frac{1}{2}$ of the water in reservoir A is transferred to reservoir B while the remainder stays in A, $\frac{1}{4}$ of the water in B goes to A while the rest is transferred to C, and the water in C is evenly split between the reservoirs. We can illustrate this change of state in the following Markov chain:

>		\draw (C) to[loop right] node[right] {$\frac{1}{3}$} (C);

>This change of state can be described using the following state-transition matrix,

>P =
>\begin{bmatrix}
>P_{A \to A} & P_{B \to A} & P_{C \to A} \\
>P_{A \to B} & P_{B \to B} & P_{C \to B} \\
>P_{A \to C} & P_{B \to C} & P_{C \to C}
\end{bmatrix} =

>The column vectors of this matrix describe the outflow of each reservoir **(or the current water in each reservoir)**, while the row vectors describe the inflow of each reservoir **(or the water in each reservoir in the next step)**. Note that each column vector add up to 1, which means that water cannot be lost in the flowing process.
